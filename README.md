# UX

## User Goals
* Visually appealing.
* Easily navigated around.
* Quality and valuable content.
* Form to save score.

## User Inputs
* As a user I want the quiz game to save my score so I can compete with my friends and family.
* As a user I want to be asked tricky question so I can test my knowlodge about Macramé.
* As a user I want to be able to make contact to the website owner via different social media.
* As a user I want to be able to easily navigate through the website.


## Owner Goals
* Spread as much information as possible about Macramé.
* Increase the number of visiters.
* Increase rankings on search engines.

### Requirements
* Easy to navigate on various screen sizes.
* Keep the user interested with information to make them want to engage with the website.
* Visually inviting so users do not leave and recommend to friends and family.

### Expectations
* I expect all links to social media sites to be opened in a new tab.
* I expect all navigation links to work correctly.
* I expect screen size not to affect the quality of the website.
* I expect all answers to the questions to be correct and accurate.


## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to make the quiz more appealing, I have used the 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main "Macramé Quiz" I have used [Beau Rivage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Beau+Rivage?query=mon "Beau Rivage Font") as I believe it needed to look different than the rest of the website but not too different that it starts looking weird. For the questions I have used the [Ibarra Real Nova]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Ibarra+Real+Nova:wght@400;500&display=swap') font and for the options I a used the [Lato]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@300&display=swap') font.
I believe these two font sits really well together.


### Icons
I have used icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will only be used where there is no explination is needed and are really common among the users like social media links.

# Wireframes
I have used Photoshop to develop wireframes for my website. I initially created the desktop version first and then scalled it down for tablet and smart phones. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the quiz.

# Testing

## Responsiveness

I feel that the site has hit the goals are required by everyone. The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the question section looks clean and responsive. It allows the user to save the their score The content is simple and to the point and the site is not overcrowded.
\
&nbsp;

## Validation

I have validated my project with the [W3C Validator](https://www.w3.org/ "HTML and CSS") and I used JShind [JShind](https://jshint.com/ "HTML and CSS") to validate my Javascript codes.

I got few warnings for HTML but I think it works for me better this way so I left them the way they are, there were no errors.

I've also got few warnings for my JavaScript files but most of them were for "Missing semicolon" so I also left them the way they were.

Below are the validation images.

* [Instagram page of Daima Zainab](http://instagram.com/daimaaaz_?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= "Instagram page of Daima Zainab")


&nbsp;

For code insperation I have looked into my first project "The Knots" to see which way the code reacted if changed into certein way and then applied the same on my second project which is Macramé Quiz project.
I also wanted to keep the same theme as my first project so in future I could link the quiz to my website.

For code inspirations I went through my notes that I took throughout the course and also I checked out few Youtube videos to understand them better.

I have also used [https://www.w3schools.com/] for code insperation and testing the code before using on my website.
