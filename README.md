# UX

## User Goals
* Visually appealing.
* Easily navigated around.
* Quality and valuable content.
* Form to save score.

## User Inputs
* As a user I want the quiz game to save my score so I can compete with my friends and family.
* As a user I want to be asked tricky question so I can test my knowlodge about Macramé.
* As a user I want to be able to make contact to the website owner via different social media.
* As a user I want to be able to easily navigate through the website.


## Owner Goals
* Spread as much information as possible about Macramé.
* Increase the number of visiters.
* Increase rankings on search engines.

### Requirements
* Easy to navigate on various screen sizes.
* Keep the user interested with information to make them want to engage with the website.
* Visually inviting so users do not leave and recommend to friends and family.

### Expectations
* I expect all links to social media sites to be opened in a new tab.
* I expect all navigation links to work correctly.
* I expect screen size not to affect the quality of the website.
* I expect all answers to the questions to be correct and accurate.


## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to make the quiz more appealing, I have used the 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main "Macramé Quiz" I have used [Beau Rivage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Beau+Rivage?query=mon "Beau Rivage Font") as I believe it needed to look different than the rest of the website but not too different that it starts looking weird. For the questions I have used the [Ibarra Real Nova]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Ibarra+Real+Nova:wght@400;500&display=swap') font and for the options I a used the [Lato]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@300&display=swap') font.
I believe these two font sits really well together.
